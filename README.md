# What is eBPF?

eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) is a revolutionary technology originating from the Linux kernel. It allows sandboxed programs to run in privileged contexts such as the operating system kernel. These programs execute safely and efficiently without modifying the kernel source code or loading new kernel modules.

## Why eBPF?

Traditionally, the operating system kernel has been the ideal place to implement critical functionality such as:
- **Observability**
- **Security**
- **Networking**

This is because the kernel has privileged access and control over the entire system.

However, evolving the kernel is a complex and risky task. Due to its core role, kernel changes must ensure system stability and security, which slows down innovation at the OS level.

### eBPF solves this by:
- Allowing rapid innovation without kernel changes
- Enabling safe, high-performance extensions to the kernel
- Maintaining system stability and security

eBPF effectively extends the capabilities of the operating system in a secure and efficient manner.
