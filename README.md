# eBPF-PROJECT
# What is eBPF?

eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) is a revolutionary technology originating from the Linux kernel. It allows sandboxed programs to run in privileged contexts such as the operating system kernel. These programs execute safely and efficiently without modifying the kernel source code or loading new kernel modules.

## Why eBPF?

Traditionally, the operating system kernel has been the ideal place to implement critical functionality such as:
- **Observability**
- **Security**
- **Networking**

This is because the kernel has privileged access and control over the entire system.

However, evolving the kernel is a complex and risky task. Due to its core role, kernel changes must ensure system stability and security, which slows down innovation at the OS level.

### eBPF solves this by:
- Allowing rapid innovation without kernel changes
- Enabling safe, high-performance extensions to the kernel
- Maintaining system stability and security

eBPF effectively extends the capabilities of the operating system in a secure and efficient manner.

## Why the Operating System Kernel?

Historically, the operating system has been the ideal place to implement observability, security, and networking functionality. This is because the kernel has a privileged positionâ€”it can observe and control all aspects of the system.

However, the kernel is also one of the most complex and sensitive parts of the operating system. Changing it is challenging due to the need for:

- High stability
- Strong security guarantees

This has traditionally made OS-level innovation slower compared to functionality developed outside the kernel.

## How eBPF Helps

eBPF enables the addition of new capabilities directly into the kernelâ€”without modifying its source code or compromising system stability. It allows safe, dynamic, and high-performance extensions to the kernel, accelerating innovation in key areas such as networking, security, and observability.
## How eBPF Changes the Game

eBPF fundamentally redefines how functionality is added to the operating system. It enables sandboxed programs to run safely within the kernel at runtime. This allows application developers to enhance operating system behavior dynamically, without modifying kernel code or loading new modules.

These eBPF programs are verified for safety and compiled just-in-time (JIT) for performance, offering execution speed comparable to native code. A built-in verification engine ensures these programs do not compromise kernel stability or security.

As a result, eBPF has sparked the development of a wide range of cutting-edge projects across domains like:

- Next-generation networking
- Deep observability and tracing
- Advanced runtime security

## Modern Use Cases of eBPF

eBPF powers a growing ecosystem of tools and use cases including:

- **High-performance networking** and **load balancing** in data centers and cloud-native environments
- **Fine-grained security observability** with minimal overhead
- **Application tracing** for performance analysis and debugging
- **Container runtime security** enforcement
- **Real-time monitoring and troubleshooting**

The possibilities with eBPF are limitless, and this is just the beginning of its transformative impact on the operating system landscape.
## Hook Overview

eBPF programs are event-driven â€” they are triggered when a specific hook point in the kernel or application is reached. These predefined hook points include:

- System calls
- Function entry and exit
- Kernel tracepoints
- Network packet events
- And many more

When these events occur, the attached eBPF program is executed within the kernel in a secure and efficient manner.

If a required hook does not exist, custom hook points can be created using:

- **kprobes**: Attach to any kernel function
- **uprobes**: Attach to user-space application functions

This gives developers fine-grained control over where and how they observe and interact with system behavior.

### ðŸ“Š Visual Representation

1. **eBPF Execution Pipeline**:
   - Event occurs â†’ eBPF program gets triggered
   - Verified for safety
   - JIT compiled for performance
   - Executed securely in kernel context

2. **Hook Types**:
   - Syscall hooks from user applications
   - kprobes and tracepoints from the kernel
   - XDP/Traffic Control hooks for networking

This flexibility allows eBPF to observe and control system behavior at almost any level â€” from user apps to the kernel and networking layers.
# ðŸš€ Loader & Verification Architecture

1. Tumne pseudo-C eBPF likha â†’ "trace karo jab `open()` syscall chale"
2. Compile kiya â†’ bytecode bana
3. bpf() syscall ke through load kiya
4. Kernel verifier ne check kiya â†’ OK diya
5. JIT ne fast native code banaya
6. Hook pe attach ho gaya
7. Jab bhi `open()` syscall trigger hoga â†’ tumhara program chalega âœ…
